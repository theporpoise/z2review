Project Status:

Next Milestone:
Get a working first version that can take in a VALID map and print out the BSQ.
This is a good first step.

Bugs:
1)Bisquick function is seg faulting.

Needs Testing in Order:
1)bisquick.c - makes the 2d array that is used by other functions
2)print_map.c
3)map_stats.c
4)timjose.c
5)fill_map.c

NEEDS REVIEW:
 1) TimJose while loop to find biggest square
-takes in stats from map_stats
-determines largest square area
-tries each spot on the map to see if square will fit
-reduce square size and keeps going until it finds
-returns coordinates of first result
2) FillMap - takes map, TimJose coords, and mstats to get char value,
 and fills in the area of the map.

Needs to be built:
I think we have everything we need for MVP, just need testing and polish.

Known Issues:
map_stats - does not check for negative integers for line lenght, we
can use atoi and do some checks, or maybe roll our own, to check
it properly.  i'd prefer to ensure core functionality is working
before tweaking input checks.  we can always add those on, whereas core
functionality we need to agre on a method and it's much bigger so requires
more communication.
