for a rectangle with sides n and n + t

numsquares = (1/6)*n(n + 1)(2n + 3t + 1)

// if we reach this number and we haven't found anything, return map error.

Start with the largest square
Move left to right, top to bottom, if there is space




WE NEED TO REMOVE ALL RECURSIVE BASIC LIBRARY FUNCTIONS!!!! (maybe)
they seem to exhaust the stack with very large inputs.
I also set an arbitrarily large malloc to test.  Malloc-ing 1 byte at a time for
arbitrarily large strings causes a huge performance bottleneck compared to
malloc-ing a lot all at once.

print_map now works... after changing the "locked function"
bisquick is a bit larger than 25 lines now I think, but it should be a lot
more readable.


//MATT'S NOTES

to run the perl script you pass in x, y, density to perl script.
perlmap 5 10 1
//generates 5 wide, 10 tall, 1 density map.
